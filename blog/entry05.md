<h1>Writeup</h1>

<p>So far, I've been learning about Github itself. How to use it. Is this the most difficult part of this class so far? Yes, yes it is. Am I going to push through anyway out of sheer spite?</p>
<br>
<p>Also yes.</p>
<p>I learned about stuff like cloning and forking. Cloning is when you copy a repository from Github onto your own computer, which is useful for saving information in case it gets deleted or messed up on the original source. Forking is similar. It's when you make a clone of someone else's work, your own personal copy. Whatever edits you do to your fork won't appear on the original, or on anyone else's forks. Though, the hardest part was memorizing all of it. It was quite difficult to figure out what meant what with all these directories and stuff! I overcame this by DMing friends on Slack for help!</p>
