  <h2>Context</h2>
  <p>
    For the past 1 or 2 weeks, me and my class have been learning CSS. I am enjoying CSS quite a bit, because it allows me to customize my websites using various borders, images, fonts and colors for my texts. As a result of CSS-induced giddiness, this website has become a kaleidoscope. I am very happy =)
  </p>
  <p>Unfortunately, this site isn't letting me so much as insert CSS at all... I can at least do images.</p>

  <p>Wait. Nevermind. It's... just a... link... awww.</p>
  <p>Anywho, DIVs. They allow you to put CSS into multiple things at once. Got a section you want to be bright blue with a silver border? Stuff it in a DIV, slap on some CSS, and that entire section will be blue! Even if you put * to do universal CSS, that single DIV will stay the way it is. That's pretty cool. Classes are another way to do it, but if you do an ID, the CSS for that ID will be seperate from the rest of its class.</p>
  <p>Truly is fascinating.</p>
  <p>Also margins! Margins help you decide how far to seperate images from the elements around it. You can make things incredibly close-knit, or have your viewers/readers scroll through it. Image resizing? Also useful! Lets you make images different sizes. If you have an important image, you can make it huge! Or if an image is too big, or perhaps unimportant? Shrink it down to a more manageable size.</p>
  <p>Then, there's padding. Padding lets you decide how thick an image's border should be. This feature may seem strange and not-useful, but trust me. Padding is a very good thing. I'm not sure how, but trust me on this. We wouldn't have learned about it if it wasn't important.</p>
  <p>Font families!! You have to find the code for fonts in order to use them, but it's very good! You can personalize your website by making the font your own!! I wonder if you can make your own special font to use... that would be so cool. I'd make my own font immediately!!</p>
  <h2>Struggles</h2>
<p>Of course, there have been some challenges... mainly in padding and margins... I've been struggling to figure out when's the right time to use them, and how to even use them properly. But I'm getting there! Communication is key, and I have tons of friends by my side who are far better than me at coding and can help me out!!</p>
<p>Anywho, here! Have a bit of CSS code that I used!</p>
<h2>Code snippet</h2>
<p>
  h1{
  border: solid, orange, 3px;
  color: hotpink;
  font-family: Sans-serif;
}

h2{
  border: dotted, green, 5px;
  color: lightgreen;
}

p{
  border: solid, silver, 3px;
  color: gold;
  font-family: Roboto;
}

body{
  background-color: black
}
</p>
<p>Pretty good, right? I was originally making this on JSBin so I could copy and paste it here, but... uh... yeah, that didn't work out.</p>
<h2>Assignment</h2>
<p>Our most recent assignment? Idk, this is due on Wednesday so we'll probably get it on Tuesday or so.</p>
