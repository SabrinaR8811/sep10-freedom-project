#### About Bootstrap

<h1>Hello, is anyone there?</h1>

<p>In class, it would appear that I've discovered an entire new world based around my favorite part of coding, CSS. This world is called Bootstrap. Bootstrap is a very impressive coding template, that allows people to create rows and columns that can adjust their width based on the size of the screen. This is possible using the container command. Also, there's container-fluid, which allows the rows and columns to shift their size depending on the screen's size without any maximum or minimum, always taking up the same percentage of space. Of course, for a set width, you would need a command such as md-col-4.</p>
<p>In my freedom project, I plan on taking full advantage of this, with rows and columns filled with actual artwork from real people.</p>
<p>I've mainly learned all of this from the Edpuzzles mr.Mueller gave us, such as https://edpuzzle.com/assignments/67c8aebcdabb9e4b8da51c55/watch</p>

<p>With Bootstrap, you can further adjust your CSS to fit your needs. There are many ways to use Bootstrap. For example, the >pre> tag is used to remove the top margin of an element, and allows you to use rem unites for the bottom. With the table class you can ensure everything in your charts and tables will be aligned perfectly, allowing for a sense of cohesiveness that some people may struggle with. The >adress> element can reset font styles to their default setting, and >abbr> provides dotted underlining to your text.
<p>The challenges I faced with learning Bootstrap were figuring out how to apply it. Computer coding is already extremely complicated, and it took me a long time to figure out how to even insert Bootstrap into my cs50. I'm still figuring out how to use it. My main takeaway from this is that no matter how hard it seems, and no matter how much you struggle, you have to keep trying. There were several times I considered giving up and even more times I did give up, but I always forced myself to try again.</p>
<p>And again.</p>
<p>And again.</p>
<p>And again.</p>
<p>Because without success, I'm stuck, and I hate being stuck.</p>
