<h1>Hello, is anyone there?</h1>

<p>In class, it would appear that I've discovered an entire new world based around my favorite part of coding, CSS. This world is called Bootstrap. Bootstrap is a very impressive coding template, that allows people to create rows and columns that can adjust their width based on the size of the screen. This is possible using the container command. Also, there's container-fluid, which allows the rows and columns to shift their size depending on the screen's size without any maximum or minimum, always taking up the same percentage of space. Of course, for a set width, you would need a command such as md-col-4.</p>
<p>In my freedom project, I plan on taking full advantage of this, with rows and columns filled with actual artwork from real people.</p>
<p>I've mainly learned all of this from the Edpuzzles mr.Mueller gave us, such as https://edpuzzle.com/assignments/67c8aebcdabb9e4b8da51c55/watch</p>
