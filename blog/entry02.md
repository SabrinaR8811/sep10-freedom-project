# Entry 2
##### October 18th, 13 days until Halloween!

<p>This week, I didn't make that much progress on my project... instead, I learned more about HTML!! This will help me out with my project. Especially listing!</p>

<ol>
  <li>I'll have a section on the pros and cons of AI art, so ordered lists will help a ton!!</li>
  <li>I can also use this for sources!!</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li> I can use unordered lists for sources too, if I want to</li>
  <li>I can even use this to list types of brushes in digital art, various apps that are available, and more!</li>
  <li>Like Ibispaint!! And... that's all I can think of off the top of my head!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Trust me this will come together eventually-</h3>
<h2>I can even add IMAGES! Images are going to be EXTREMELY useful!</h2>
<img src = "kenhina.jpg">
<p>As for challenges, I'm still figuring out stuff about inserting links... links are hard. I also still have to memorize Itallics?</p>
<p>My main takeaways are that divs can be very useful, but very difficult. That's why there are none here. There will be divs in the next entry.</p>
<p>Here, have a code snippet!</p>
<p>"img src = kenhina.jpg"</p>
<p>I used that for the image!!</p>
