<h2>Freedom Project Blog Entry</h2>

<p>This blog is about my freedom project. In this blog, I will be logging as much as I possibly can, putting everything into this single assignment.</p>

<p>First off, I've made a lot of progress on what my project will be about. While the general consensus is art, I will be going into high amounts of detail on a few specific subjects, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The differences between digital art and traditional art</li>
  <li>Reasons why, despite what many believe, traditional art is far better than digital art</li>
  <li>How technology has been slowly but surely ruining art</li>
</ul>

<p>I may also include a small segment on how technology is bad for the Earth and contributing to global warming.</p>

<p>In terms of the project itself, I've been waiting for when I fully master SASS to get to work on it, but as of right now I have a pretty good idea of the HTML and what it'll look like. I have the class names for the DIVs, and I'll be making the wireframe quite soon. There will be a Navbar on the top, with the following image as a background:</p>

<p>The Navbar will have several options. Home, which will be the starting screen. History of art and technology, the potential future of art and technology, technology's impact on art in all its forms, and why AI is destroying art.</p>
<p>Of course, these won't be the full names in the Navbar, as those would be too long. It'll likely just be History, Potential Future, Impact, and AI Art.</p>
<p>In the History section, I'll have a timeline in the form of a Carousel-style slideshow depicting how art began, with the first-ever cave paintings, all the way up to how art is now. In the Potential Future section, I'll have a grid with 3 separate possible timelines for how art and technology might change in the future:</p>
<ol>
  <li>If traditional art falls out of style</li>
  <li>If AI art takes over</li>
  <li>If traditional art makes a comeback</li>
</ol>
<p>In the Impact section, I will be going into more detail on how technology has changed art throughout history. Finally, in the AI art section, I will be writing about how AI is slowly ruining art and why we should get rid of it. In this particular section, I will be showing bits of AI art that show how uncanny AI art is, how terrible it is and why it shouldn't exist. I will also include several art pieces from an online trend that went around a little under a year ago. The trend is called "Forget AI art", and while that is not the actual name, I have chosen to censor it for educational purposes. It began when someone saw a piece of AI art, got sick of it, and replicated it in their own style with the caption "Forget AI art." Soon, more people began to replicate the drawing, in an act of rebellion against AI art.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>

<p>Finally, I'll be using SASS to decorate this blog every color of the rainbow. Not in a messy way, but in a gradient. The homescreen will have monochrome colors, but it will slowly melt into cool colors such as blue and green, then lighter shades, until it reaches vibrant and warmer shades at the very end.</p>
