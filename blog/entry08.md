<h2>Freedom Project Blog Entry</h2>

<p>Over these past few weeks, I have been slowly learning how to use SASS. I've been learning a lot so far!! I learned SASS is mostly used as a CSS special form of coding, that utilizes the $ sign for variables. It allows you to nest variables for better organization. It also lets you create partial files, share properties between variables without need to repeat them, and even import CSS files! It's very useful, and can really take your CSS to the next level.</p>
<p>One thing that challenged me was the math. SASS requires a lot more math expertise, which is why I nearly gave up on it. Then, I remembered that I have... a calculator!! So I used the calculator and was able to master my new CSS skillset!</p>
