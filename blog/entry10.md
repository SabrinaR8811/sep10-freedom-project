# Entry 10
##### Hello!! It's me, for the last time!!

<p>Well folks, we made it! My final SEP blog!! How'd I end up with 10 entries though if we were meant to make 7? No clue!! </p>
<p>Ooooooh boy, it's been a WILD ride. Next year I'll be in the Journalism elective, or the art elective. Maybe music. Maybe even psychology. Now that I'm leaving this class, I don't know what the future holds for me, and I love it.</p>
<p>So, since I already changed my pfp, name, etc, I might as well focus pocus on the whole thing with the final presentations and all, y'know?</p>
<p>So, takeaways. My main one: NEVER PROCRASTINATE. My freedom project was a Hot Messâ„¢ and I don't exactly wanna drop something like that again.</p>
<p>My main takeaway from the in-class presentations, of course, was that there is always time to edit. I could have done so much more with my slides but I gave up because I thought I'd lost the time. I mean, look at this!!</p>

<p>It's a mess!! Anywho, my main takeaway for the actual presenting to the judges... well, nothing, really. THAT went amazing.</p>
