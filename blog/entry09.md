<h2>Making my MVP</h2>
<p>Making my MVP was one of the hardest pieces of schoolwork I've had to do in my entire life. Second only to that one time in 8th grade when I was missing 18 assignments in my worst class and had to do them all in just a few nights so I'd have free time during winter break.</p>
<p>Anywho.</p>
<p>I mainly did it through a LOT of research, finding bits and pieces of what I wanted to do. Things I could work with. I didn't want to work by a template, or anything like that. So in the end? My MVP was a hot mess, but I at least managed to get in some good code.</p>
<p>
  "<div style="text-transform:uppercase;text-align:right;">"

		
			"<span style="font-family:impact,arial black;font-size:31px;color:#FFD76A;display:block;">Freedom Project</span>"

		
			"<span style="color:#fff;font-weight:bold;font-size:10px;letter-spacing:3px;">Made by Sabrina R.</span>"

		"</div>"
</p>
<p>That's a bit of the code I used for the main heading!!</p>
<p>My biggest takeaway was to always ask for help and always use a template. Everything I did was royally messed up, and barely even coherent. It took a lot of work in my Beyond MVP to actually make something worth a decent grade.</p>
