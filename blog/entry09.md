<h2>Making my MVP</h2>
<p>Making my MVP was one of the hardest pieces of schoolwork I've had to do in my entire life. Second only to that one time in 8th grade when I was missing 18 assignments in my worst class and had to do them all in just a few nights so I'd have free time during winter break.</p>
<p>Anywho.</p>
<p>I mainly did it through a LOT of research, finding bits and pieces of what I wanted to do. Things I could work with. I didn't want to work by a template, or anything like that. So in the end? My MVP was a hot mess, but I at least managed to get in some good code.</p>
<p>
  "<div style="text-transform:uppercase;text-align:right;">"

		
			"<span style="font-family:impact,arial black;font-size:31px;color:#FFD76A;display:block;">Freedom Project</span>"

		
			"<span style="color:#fff;font-weight:bold;font-size:10px;letter-spacing:3px;">Made by Sabrina R.</span>"

		"</div>"
</p>
<p>That's a bit of the code I used for the main heading!!</p>
<p>My biggest takeaway was to always ask for help and always use a template. Everything I did was royally messed up, and barely even coherent. It took a lot of work in my Beyond MVP to actually make something worth a decent grade.</p>
<p>My biggest challenge was the photos. The. Dang. PHOTOS. Honestly, the amount of time it took me to force my images to upload properly into the website was insane, and even then I could only manage a few of them. Still, it was worth it, because my site looked a lot better for it.</p>
<p>The easiest part, on the other hand, was definitely all of the basic HTML. Typing in different sections and paragraphs was my jam throughout the entire project, and it was what I excelled at. I was easily typing up my paragraphs, and for the first time since... about Unit 3... I actually found myself having fun when coding. The CSS was also fairly easy, as it required a lot less programming than the HTML. Overall, this was... still extremely difficult but not as bad as I expected. 8/10 on hardness level instead of the 12/10 that I thought it'd be.</p>
