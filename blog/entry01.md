### Entry 1 ~ The Wheel has Spoken
## October 8th, 2024 ~ 23 days until Halloween

For a while, I was stuck between three possible topics. I could do Journalism, which was what my future career will be. I could do art, an old passion and hobby of mine. I could even do music, which was something that had always been my mental sanctuary. Due to my indecisiveness, I turned to a wheel picker. 100 options- 33% said Journalism, 33% said Art, 33% said Music, an that final 1% said "Spin Again." I spun the wheel, and the Universe spoke its honest whisper. <br>
That whisper... said "Art"<br>
Art has been around since ancient times. The first cavemen used art, and art will last long past us humans are extinct. Art has always been a form of human expression. A glimpse into someone's soul. Add technology into the mix, and you get all sorts of possibilities in the form of layers, undo buttons that leave no erase marks, color pickers, and specialized brushes. Some particular articles on art that called my attention were “[The State of Digital Art](https://artmarketingnews.com/digital-art/)”, “[The Fusion of Art and Technology](https://mediatech.edu/the-fusion-of-art-and-technology/)” , and “[Is AI-generated art actually art?](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/discover/is-ai-generated-art-actually-art)”. Personally, in my opinion, AI art is never art. Each article caught my attention in a different way, and I'm glad I took the time to read them. I love art, and I love technology, so this subject will be perfect for me!!
